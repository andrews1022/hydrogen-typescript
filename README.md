# Hydrogen TypeScript

Just messing around with the Hydrogen Starter Template. Goal is to remove Tailwind and replace with Styled Components. Then to convert everything to TypeScript.

Just using GitHub to keep track of progress. Check out the original repo [here](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen).
